## Research Interests

My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision, particularly in the following areas:

- **Multimodal Learning**: Unifying representations across different modalities to enable comprehensive interpretation of deep learning models
- **Visual Understanding**: Developing models for image understanding, object detection, and scene analysis
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Prediction and generation of time-series data with applications in various domains
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Creating robust representations without extensive labeled data

## Recent Research Highlights

### SINDER: Repairing the Singular Defects of DINOv2 (ECCV 2024, Oral)

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to examining defects in vision foundation models, achieving significant efficiency improvementsâ€”saving over 3,000 GPU hours compared to existing methods. Congratulations to Haoqi on her first project at EPFL!

### MeshNCA (SIGGRAPH 2024)

Our work on Neural Cellular Automata for mesh generation has been accepted to SIGGRAPH 2024. This approach enables efficient and controllable generation of 3D meshes through local update rules.

### 3D-Aware Hypothesis & Verification for Generalizable Relative Object Pose Estimation (ICLR 2024)

We developed a novel approach for estimating relative object poses that generalizes well across different object categories and scenes.

### Mind Your Augmentation: The Key to Decoupling Dense Self-Supervised Learning (ICLR 2024)

This work explores the critical role of data augmentation strategies in self-supervised learning frameworks, demonstrating significant improvements in representation quality.

### DyNCA: Real-Time Dynamic Texture Synthesis Using Neural Cellular Automata (CVPR 2023)

We presented a method for generating dynamic textures in real-time using neural cellular automata, which enables efficient creation of continuously evolving visual patterns.

### Modeling Object Dissimilarity for Deep Saliency (TMLR)

Our research on improving saliency detection by explicitly modeling object dissimilarity provides a novel perspective on visual attention mechanisms.
