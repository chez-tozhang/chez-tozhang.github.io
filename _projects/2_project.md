## MeshNCA: Neural Cellular Automata for 3D Mesh Generation

A novel approach for generating 3D meshes using neural cellular automata, enabling efficient and controllable creation of complex 3D structures through local update rules. This work has been accepted to SIGGRAPH 2024.

### Project Overview

MeshNCA introduces a framework where 3D meshes emerge from simple local interactions between mesh elements. Unlike traditional 3D generation approaches, our method operates directly on mesh vertices and faces, resulting in efficient and coherent mesh structures.

### Technical Approach

- Developed a graph-based neural cellular automaton architecture for mesh generation
- Created specialized update rules that preserve mesh topology while allowing for complex deformations
- Implemented multi-scale control mechanisms for directing the generation process
- Designed a differentiable rendering pipeline for end-to-end training

### Key Innovations

One of the major contributions of this work is the formulation of mesh-specific update rules that maintain mesh integrity while enabling creative generation. We developed novel mechanisms for handling topological changes and ensuring mesh quality throughout the generation process.

### Applications

MeshNCA enables several compelling applications:

1. **Interactive Design Tools**: Real-time mesh manipulation and generation
2. **Procedural Content Creation**: Generating diverse 3D assets for games and simulations
3. **Mesh Completion and Repair**: Filling missing regions and fixing defects in 3D scans
4. **Style Transfer for 3D Models**: Applying learned stylistic elements across different 3D objects

### Interactive Demo

We've created an interactive demo that allows users to experience MeshNCA firsthand. The demo enables real-time control over the generation process and exploration of different parameter settings.

### Code and Resources

The code for MeshNCA is available on our GitHub repository: [MeshNCA Repository](https://github.com/IVRL/MeshNCA)

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
