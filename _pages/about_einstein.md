I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn), where I lead the **Omni-Representation Lab (OmniRep)** lab, part of the [LAMP](http://lamp.ucas.ac.cn) research group. Before joining UCAS, I spent several wonderful years in Lausanne, Switzerland, at EPFL's [Image and Visual Representation Lab (IVRL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/), working with [Prof. Sabine SÃ¼sstrunk](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/people/susstrunk/) and [Dr. Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann). Prior to that, I earned my Ph.D. from the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra, under the guidance of [Prof. Richard Hartley](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hartley/), [Prof. Hongdong Li](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/), [Prof. Mehrtash Harandi](https://sites.google.com/site/mehrtashharandi/), and [Prof. Fatih Porikli](http://www.porikli.com). During my Ph.D. studies, I received the **Best Student Paper Honorable Mention** at *ACCV 2016* and was a **Paper Award Finalist** at *CVPR 2020*.
