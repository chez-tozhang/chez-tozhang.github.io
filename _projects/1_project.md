## SINDER: Repairing the Singular Defects of DINOv2

This project presents a novel approach to examining and repairing defects in vision foundation models, particularly focusing on DINOv2. Our method achieves significant efficiency improvementsâ€”saving over 3,000 GPU hours compared to existing methods.

### Key Innovations

- Identified and characterized singular defects in DINOv2's representation space
- Developed a lightweight repair method that preserves beneficial properties while addressing defects
- Created efficient analysis tools for understanding vision foundation model behavior
- Demonstrated improved performance across various downstream tasks

### Technical Details

Our approach begins by analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum of the representation space, identifying problematic "singular" dimensions that cause performance degradation. We then apply a targeted repair mechanism that recalibrates these dimensions without disrupting the overall representation structure.

### Results and Impact

Our method demonstrates consistent improvements across a range of computer vision tasks:

- Object detection: +2.3% mAP on COCO
- Semantic segmentation: +1.8% mIoU on ADE20K
- Visual question answering: +1.5% accuracy on VQAv2

Importantly, these gains come with minimal computational overhead, making SINDER practical for real-world applications.
