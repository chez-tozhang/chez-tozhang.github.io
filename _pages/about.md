# Dr. Tong Zhang

I am a postdoctoral researcher working in machine learning and computer vision at EPFL with Prof. Sabine SÃ¼sstrunk and Dr. Mathieu Salzmann. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Australian National University (ANU) in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Richard Hartley, Prof. Faith Porikli, Prof. Mehrtash Harandi, and Prof. Hongdong Li. After submitting my thesis, I worked on a semantic geo-localization project along with some Ph.D. students at ANU. During my Ph.D. study, I received the Best Student Paper honorable mention at ACCV 2016 and the Paper Award Finalist at CVPR 2020.

Prior to that, I received a master's degree from New York University in 2014 and a bachelor's degree from Beihang University in 2011.

## Research Focus

Currently, my focus lies in unifying representations across different modalities to enable comprehensive interpretation of deep learning models, thereby facilitating broader applications in fields like time-series prediction and generation.

IVRL is always taking highly motivated Ph.D. students, who receive fellowships from the computer science (IC) department. We also have limited positions for self-funded visiting students. 

Every summer, we take some excellent students from the Summer@EPFL program.

I will be serving as an Area Chair for NeurIPS 2025.
